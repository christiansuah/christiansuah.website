    <h3>1) What is HTML and what does it stand for? Answer:HTML defines the structure of web content by using a variety of elements and tags to format text, embed images, create links, and more.</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages and web applications.</p>
    <h3>2) What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used to create web pages, but they have some key differences:
           Syntax Rules:
           HTML: More lenient with syntax rules. Browsers can often correct minor errors in HTML code.
           XHTML: Stricter syntax rules. It follows XML (Extensible Markup Language) standards, meaning all tags must be properly nested, closed, and written in lowercase.
           Error Handling:
           HTML: Browsers are forgiving and will try to render the page even if there are errors.
           XHTML: Browsers will not render the page if there are syntax errors.
           Document Structure:
           HTML: Doctype declaration is optional.
           XHTML: Requires a doctype declaration and the xmlns attribute in the <html> tag to specify the XML namespace.
           Element and Attribute Naming:
           HTML: Tags and attributes can be written in uppercase or lowercase.
           XHTML: Tags and attributes must be written in lowercase.
           Empty Elements:
           HTML: Empty elements (like <br>, <img>) do not need to be closed.
           XHTML: Empty elements must be closed (e.g., <br />, <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" />)1.
           Compatibility:
           HTML: Widely supported by all browsers.
           XHTML: Also supported by all major browsers, but requires stricter adherence to standards  </p>

    <h3>3) What are the basic building blocks of an HTML document?</h3>

        <ol>The basic building blocks of an HTML document include:</ol>
        <li> DOCTYPE html: Declaration defining the document type.</li>
        <li> html: Root element of the HTML document.</li>
        <li> head: Contains meta-information, title, and links to styles/scripts.</li>
        <li> title: Sets the title of the web page.</li>
        <li> body: Contains the content of the web page (text, images, links, etc.).</li>
    <h3> 4)How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?</h3>
        <p>  You can create a hyperlink using the <strong>a</strong> tag. For example:</p>
    
        <p> a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a></p>
    <h3> 5.What is the purpose of the "alt" attribute in the HTML "img" tag?</h3>
        <p> The "alt" attribute provides alternative text for an image if it cannot be displayed. It is important for accessibility, as it helps screen readers describe the image<br/> to visually impaired users and provides context if the image fails to load.</p>
    <h3> 6) How can you create a table in HTML?</h3><br>
           Explanation
        <p> table: Defines the table.</p>
        </p> Tr: Defines a row in the table.</p>

        <p>td: Defines a standard cell in the table.</p>
    <h3>7) What is the purpose of the "doctype" declaration in HTML?</h3>
        <p>slution:</p>
        <p>Document Type Definition: It informs the web browser about the version of HTML being used in the document.<br/> This helps the browser render the page correctly</p>
    <h3>8) What is the difference between HTML elements and HTML tags?</h3>
        <p>HTML Tags<p>
        <p>Definition: Tags are the markup used to create HTML elements. They are the actual code that defines the beginning and end of an element.</p>
        <p>Structure: Tags are enclosed in angle brackets. For example, <p> is a start tag for a paragraph, and </p> is the end tag.</p>
        <p>Types: There are two types of tags:
        <p>Start Tag: tagname></p>
        <p>End Tag: tagname></p>
        <p>Some tags are self-closing, such as <br /> or <img />, which do not require an end tag.</p>
        <p>HTML Elements</p>
        <p>Definition: An HTML element refers to the complete structure that includes the start tag, content, and end tag (if applicable).</p>
        <p>Structure: An element consists of everything from the start tag to the end tag, including any nested elements or text. For example:</p>
        <p>Copy</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
           Here, the entire <p>This is a paragraph.</p> is the HTML element.</p>
    <h3>9) How do you add comments in HTML?</h3>
        <p>Key Points:</p>
        </p> Visibility: Comments are not displayed in the browser; they are only visible in the source code.</p>
        </p> Purpose: They are used to leave notes for yourself or other developers, explain sections of code, or temporarily disable code without deleting it.</p>
        </p> Multi-line Comments: You can also use comments for multiple lines by placing the comment syntax around the text:

    <h3>10) What is the significance of the "head" section in an HTML document?</h3>
        <p>The <head> section is crucial for defining the document's title, linking resources, and providing metadata that enhances the functionality and presentation of the web page.</p>
    <h3>11) How do you define headings in HTML?</h3>
        <p>In HTML, headings are defined using the h1 to h6 tags, where h1 represents the highest level of heading and h6 represents the lowest. Here's a brief overview:</p>

        <p> h1>: Main heading (usually the title of the page)<p>
        <p> h2>: Subheading of h2<p>
        <p> h3>: Subheading of h2<p>
        <p> h4>: Subheading of h3<p>
        <p> h5>: Subheading of h></p>

        <p> Behavior: They flow within the text and can be placed next to each other.</p>
        <p> Examples:</p>p>
                
        <p> Summary of Differences:</p>
